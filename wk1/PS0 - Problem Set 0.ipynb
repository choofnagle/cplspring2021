Please do the assigned reading before attempting the problem set.\n",

Students who have many other intensive competing obligations might struggle. To help you gauge what this means for you, we are assigning this mini-problem-set for you to try to solve before the start of the first lecture of this class. The answer will be discussed in your first lab meeting."
